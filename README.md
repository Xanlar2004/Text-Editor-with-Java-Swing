  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>This project demonstrates how to develop a text editor using the Java Swing library. This text editor allows users to save and open text files through a graphical user interface (GUI). Built with the Java Swing library, the application provides a simple and easy-to-use design with buttons for saving and opening text files. Grab a seat, pour a cup of coffee, and start using the text editor application!</p>

  <p>This text editor is a GUI system that enables users to create and save text files or open and modify existing files easily. The user-friendly design includes buttons and a text area, allowing users to write text in the text area and save it to their device. Users can open a text file available on their device, modify it, and save the changes as needed.</p>
  <p>Key features include:<br>
     - A simple design with buttons for saving and opening text files.<br>
     - TextArea for writing and editing content.<br>
     - Ability to save files using the save button or open files using the open button.<br>
     - Modification and saving of existing files.</p>

  <h2>Methods Used in the Project</h2>
